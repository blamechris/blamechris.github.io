            <b>IRP: Integrated Report Processor</b>: A standalone report processor developed to assist with the processing
            of testbed reports generated by the Clipper missions testing platform. The program was developed using 
            Python and the Pandas library and was designed to be used by instrument engineers to expedite review.
            <br>
            Project imported a 600,000+ line raw report file, and parsed it for data relevent to specifications to 
            reduce the size of the file by 70% or more. This allowed engineers to more quickly review the reports as
            well as mitigated some of the detrimental effects of the large file size on the system.

            <b>Dodging Game:</b> A simple game developed using Java and the JavaFX library. The game was developed as part
            of a local gamejam in 2020. It consisted of a player character that could move around the screen and
            needed to avoid randomly generated monsters that moved across the screen. The game was developed in 
            6 hours and was my first experience with Java and JavaFX.

            <b>QuoteBot:</b> A Discord bot developed using Python and the Discord.py library. The bot was developed as a 
            fun pet project to familiarize myself with the Discord API and to learn more about Python. The bot 
            calls the Quotes REST API to allow users to request quotes from a variety of categories. The bot also 
            has some minor moderation features and the ability to periodically post a quote to a specified channel.
